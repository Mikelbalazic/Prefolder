    <p>My name is Mikel Reed Balazic and I am a Designer, Artist, and creative based in the Greater Toronto Area. Graduating from York University's and Sheridan College's Bachelor of Design program, my main interest is finding a creative solution to a problem with efficiency and technical standard. I also hold myself accountable for how much time I can accrue for each project, and this dictates how far I can explore the endless variables of a particular project. Ultimately, my work is involved with the world of communication, and it delights me most of all to know that I can create design that best reflects what message is being conveyed.</p>
